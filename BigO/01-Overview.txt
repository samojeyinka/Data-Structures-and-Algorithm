BigO is so important for every software engineers,even you
 cannot get into any big comapnies without encoutering big o questions and 
 test - Its official term is BigO asymptotic analysis - 
 web - (Big O notation (with a capital letter O, not a zero), 
 also called Landau's symbol, is a symbolism used in complexity theory, 
 computer science, and mathematics to describe the asymptotic behavior of functions.
  Basically, it tells you how fast a function grows or declines.) - Any coder given
   enough time can solve a problem,what matters is the how well the problem is 
   solved - This is where BigO comes in - it can tell us how well the problem is 
   soled - We can use BigO and its different notion  to distinguish betwn good code 
   and bad code
