What is good code

1. Readability - clean code,others can read and understand your code
2. Scalability - scalable code,BigO gave us the ideq to measure the Scalability/performance
of a code

BigO notion is the language we used for  talking about how long an Algorithm takes to run,we can compare two different
Algorithm using BigO to see which on is better in Scalability regardless of the computer differences
